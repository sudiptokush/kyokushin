                <li>Strive to seize the initiative in all things, all the time guarding against actions stemming from selfish animosity or thoughtlessness.</li>
                <li>Even for the Martial Artist, the place of money cannot be ignored. Yet one should be careful never to become attached to it.</li>
                <li>The Martial Way is centred in posture. Strive to maintain correct posture at all times.</li>
                <li>The Martial Way begins with one thousand days and is mastered after ten thousand days of training.</li>
                <li>In the Martial Arts, introspection begets wisdom. Always see contemplation on your actions as an opportunity to improve.</li>
                <li>The nature and purpose of the Martial Way is universal. All selfish desires should be roasted in the tempering fires of hard training.</li>
                <li>The Martial Arts begin with a point and end in a circle. Straight lines stem from this principle.</li>
                <li>The true essence of the Martial Way can only be realized through experience. Knowing this, learn never to fear its demands.</li>
                <li>Always remember, in the Martial Arts the rewards of a confident and grateful heart are truly abundant.</li>
