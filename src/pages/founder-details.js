                The tiny village of Wa-Ryongri is not far from the town of Kinje, close to Gunsan in
                south-west Korea. Yong I-Choi, son of the mayor of Kinje, was born there on 27 th
                July 1923. It was only in his teens, as an aspiring fighter-pilot training in Japan,
                that the future founder of Kyokushin Karate was to adopt the name by which he is
                remembered today, Masutatsu Oyama.

                <p>
                Sent to live on his sister’s estate in Manchuria, Yong I-Choi commenced his
                training in the martial arts at the early age of nine, gaining proficiency in the
                Eighteen Hands technique of the South Chinese form of Kempo. On his return to
                Korea at the age of 12, he continued his training, only to leave for Japan three
                years later to train as an aviator, inspired by his hero, Korea’s first fighter pilot.
                Enrolled in Japan’s Yamanashi Youth Air Force Academy, Oyama also joined the
                dojo of Gichin Funakoshi at Takushoku University. By the time he entered the
                Japanese Imperial Army at the age of 20, Oyama was already a 2 nd Dan in Karate
                and had also trained in judo. Despair at the defeat of Japan in World War II and
                the subsequent shame of Occupation caused him to abandon his military career
                but his training in the martial arts continued, under the tutelage of So Nei Chu,
                one of the foremost exponents of the Goju Ryu style, who also happened to be
                from Oyama’s own province in Korea.

                Master So’s suggestion was that his pupil should spend three years in retreat from
                the world, dedicating himself entirely to the training of his mind and body, to
                prepare himself for the lifelong pursuit of the Martial Way. A meeting with Eiji
                Yoshikawa, author of the novel Musashi, based on the history of Japan’s most
                famous Samurai and a striking exposition of the Samurai Bushido code,
                strengthened Oyama’s resolve. In the same year (1946), he began his solitary
                training on Mt Minobu in the Chiba Prefecture. The location was appropriate and
                historic: Musashi had developed his Nito-ryu style of swordfighting on the same
                mountain. Oyama’s few possessions on the mountain included a copy of
                Yoshikawa’s novel. His companion, Yashiro, fled back to civilization in six months.
                Urged by his teacher, Oyama stayed on alone till, at the end of fourteen months,
                his sponsor failed him and he was obliged to return.

                <p>
                A few months later, in 1947, Oyama won the karate section of the first Japanese
                National Martial Arts Championships after World War II. But his actual quest was
                one of the spirit: in search of the true essence of his art, he entered upon a
                second period of solitary training, this time on Mount Kiyozumi.
                </p>

                <p>
                For eighteen months, Oyama trained 12 hours a day with no rest days, punishing
                his body with exposure to the harshest natural elements, pitting his endurance
                against freezing waterfalls and steep mountain slopes, breaking boulders with his
                hands, jumping hundreds of times daily over rapidly growing flax plants,
                practicing strikes with tree-trunks as his makiwaras. His training included daily
                meditation and the study of ancient Buddhist and Zen philosophy.

                <p>
                At the end of eighteen arduous months, Sosai Oyama emerged from his retreat.
                1950 may properly be called the first year of his public career, which began with
                fighting bulls. Of the 52 bulls he fought, three were killed immediately and 49 had
                their horns taken off with knife-hand blows. On the other hand, his very first
                attempt at bull-fighting resulted in a near-fatal injury to Oyama himself.

                <p>
                In 1952, Sosai Oyama traveled to the USA for a year. There he demonstrated his
                art live and on national television and in subsequent years, fought all challengers
                – a total of 270 opponents. Most were defeated with a single punch, in a matter
                of seconds – no fight lasted longer than three minutes. Oyama came to be known
                as the Godhand, fighting by the ancient creed of Japanese warriors. Ichi geki,
                Hissatsu. One strike, certain death.

                <p>
                In 1953 Mas Oyama opened his first dojo, on a grass lot in Mejiro, Tokyo. His first
                proper dojo followed in 1956, in a former ballet studio behind Rikkyo University,
                only 500 metres from the present-day Honbu Dojo, the headquarters of the
                Kyokushin school. By 1957, there were 700 members, though the grueling training
                ensured a similarly high drop-out rate.
                </p>

                <p>
                Jis-sen kumite (full contact fighting) was the main attraction, drawing
                practitioners from other styles. Kyokushin technique, as developed by Oyama,
                was eclectic and multiform, receptive to the influence of other styles,
                incorporating any techniques that promised to be effective in a real fight. The
                members of his dojo considered themselves students of a fighting art: kumite was
                their focus and they fought hard, striking (with a few restrictions) to both head
                and body, grabbing and throwing.

                <p>
                Over the course of his career, Sosai Oyama attracted many illustrious disciples:
                Jacques Sandulescu, a Romanian ex-prisoner of the Red Army, whom he met on
                one of his visits to the United States, became a lifelong friend and one of the IKO’s
                first advisors. Shihan Bobby Lowe was a young man when he watched Oyama
                demonstrate his formidable powers in Hawai in 1952. Already a high-ranking
                practitioner of several martial arts, Shihan Lowe became Sosai’s first uchi-deshi or
                live-in student, like a shishya in an Indian gurukul. Only a few such uchi-deshi
                were chosen yearly from the hundreds of applicants, and they became known as
                the Wakajishi or ‘Young Lions’ of Mas Oyama.
                </p>

                <p>
                In 1857, Shihan Lowe returned to Hawaii to open the first school of Mas Oyama’s
                technique outside Japan. The current World Headquarters at Honbu were opened
                in June 1964, where the name Kyokushin, meaning ‘Ultimate Truth’ was adopted.
                The International Karate Organisation (IKO) was started in the same year.
                Kyokushin’s first World Karate-Do Open Tournament was held in 1975 and Sosai is
                remembered as the initiator of full-contact, bare-knuckle tournament fighting.
                Today, the style is practiced in 135 countries, and the IKO has over 12 million
                registered members, making it one of the world’s largest martial arts
                organizations.
                </p>

                <p>
                Sosai Oyama passed away on 26 th April 1994. He was 70 years old and suffering
                from lung cancer. Kancho Shokei Matsui was named as his successor and is
                currently the head of the International Karate Organisation. Under his guidance,
                and in the benign shadow of its great founder, the IKO has grown into the largest
                karate organization in the world. Out of the original, close-knit Kyokushin family
                has emerged a formidable diaspora.
