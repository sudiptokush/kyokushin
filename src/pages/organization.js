                    <p>
                      Shokei (Akiyoshi) Matsui was born in Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, on 15 th January
                      1963. As a young boy, the quiet, reserved Akiyoshi showed little sign of
                      being destined to dominate the world of Kyokushin Karate. Winner of two
                      consecutive All-Japan Opens, the youngest World Champion ever, the first
                      fighter in thirteen years to complete the 100-Man Kumite, he received the
                      ultimate honour of being nominated Kancho (president) of the International
                      Karate Organisation Kyokushinkaikan by the legendary Mas Oyama
                      himself.
