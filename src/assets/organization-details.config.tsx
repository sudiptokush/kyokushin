                                    Kancho Shokei Matsui (IKO, Kyokushin kai kan)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Shokei (Akiyoshi) Matsui was born in Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, on 15 th January
                                    1963. As a young boy, the quiet, reserved Akiyoshi showed little sign of
                                    being destined to dominate the world of Kyokushin Karate. Winner of two
                                    consecutive All-Japan Opens, the youngest World Champion ever, the first
                                    fighter in thirteen years to complete the 100-Man Kumite, he received the
                                    ultimate honour of being nominated Kancho (president) of the International
                                    Karate Organisation Kyokushinkaikan by the legendary Mas Oyama
                                    himself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Like many young people of his generation, Matsui first encountered the
                                    martial arts in the form of Karate Baka Ichidai, the popular graphic novel
                                    series based on the life and art of Sosai Mas Oyama. Matsui’s karate training
                                    began at the age of thirteen at the North Chiba Kyokushin Branch. His first
                                    meeting with Sosai Oyama took place in the same year, at the So Honbu
                                    Summer Training Camp. Of the many lessons he learnt from his future
                                    mentor, it was Sosai’s proverbial creed of Ichi geki, Hissatsu that the young
                                    trainee adopted as his motto. All through his fighting career, Matsui believed
                                    in knocking out his opponent with a single strike.
                                </p>

                                    Having attained the rank of Shodan (first degree black belt) in the incredibly
                                    short space of sixteen months, Matsui was allowed by Shigeo Kato, then
                                    North Chiba Branch chief and instrumental in developing his protégé’s
                                    talent, to compete in one of the biggest Japanese regional championships.
                                    The fourteen-year old advanced to the third round, and discovered the
                                    excitement of competitive fighting as well as the difference between dojo
                                    kumite(practice sparring) and jiyu kumite (free sparring). He went on to take
                                    2 nd place at the Chiba Prefecture Tournament when he was just seventeen.
                                    Matsui knew he could have done even better, but turned his disappointment into
                                    motivation for his first All-Japan Open entry in 1980. His remarkable
                                    fourth-place finish earned him the attention and respect of the entire
                                    Kyokushin world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 1981, Matsui entered Chuo University in Tokyo and switched to Honbu
                                    Dojo, training ground of fighters like Makoto Nakamura, Keiji Sanpei and
                                    Koichi Kawabata. Matsui’s genius blossomed in Honbu’s keenly
                                    competitive environment. At the same time, he felt under enormous pressure
                                    to prove that the previous year’s success was not just a lucky win. In the end,
                                    he proved it in no uncertain terms, taking third place at the All Japan Open
                                    not just that year, but the following year too.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, Matsui’s career was frequently threatened by injury – the result of
                                    intensive weight-training and trials of endurance. Injuries kept him out of the
                                    16 th All Japan Open, marked by the meteoric rise of his contemporary and
                                    rival, Hiroki Kurosawa. Kurosawa’s success propelled Matsui back into
                                    competition: fittingly, in the 17 th Open, it was Kurosawa who faced Matsui
                                    in the fight for the title. Countering his opponent’s merciless low kicks with
                                    a barrage of attacks, Matsui won the match 5-0 in the first extension to
                                    become the All-Japan Open Champion. Recalling his post-match handshake
                                    with Sosai Oyama, Matsui said later that he could happily have died right
                                    there, because he had accomplished the goal he had always dreamt of.
                                    The next test of Matsui’s ability was the definitive challenge of Kyokushin
                                    Karate – the 100-Man Kumite. Sosai Oyama spoke of it as the ultimate proof
                                    of a fighter’s mastery of Budo-Karate. “It means fighting till you think you
                                    cannot stand up any more, but you have to go on. When you are young, just
                                    try once. You do not need to try it two or three times; if you do, you cannot
                                    live long.” (translated from Power Karate by Ayako Shimizu).

                                <p>
                                    Matsui’s historic feat was accomplished on 18 th May 1986, in a Tokyo film-
                                    studio decorated like the Honbu dojo, before an audience of five hundred
                                    people. Shihan Yuzo Goda acted as referee. To avoid the use of open hands,
                                    each fighter had to hold small pieces of wood in his fists. Dropping one
                                    would entitle the other to a waza-ari. Warming up, Matsui appeared relaxed,
                                    and quite oblivious of his audience.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The last successful 100-Man Kumite, Karate’s equivalent of an Olympic
                                    Marathon, had been completed by Miuki Miura, thirteen years ago. Only
                                    two fighters had ever completed the challenge before Matsui: stalwarts like
                                    Keiji Sanpei, Makoto Nakamura and Kazuo Miyoshi had all tried and failed.
                                    Matsui’s achievement was exceptional: he won 75 out of a hundred fights,
                                    and more than half with ippon-gachi (single-strike knockdowns). His last
                                    point was won with a jodan mawashi that he managed to produce in his 95 th
                                    fight. No round (ten fights) lasted longer than 20 minutes – most were
                                    finished in less than 15. In the sixth round (fights 61-70), he won two fights
                                    in twenty seconds with ippons for jodan mawashi. Struggling against
                                    exhaustion, but still managing to fell opponents with his ashi barai (foot
                                    sweep), Matsui finished his 100 th fight, and stayed on his feet to shake hands
                                    with Sosai Oyama and receive the congratulations of his fans. He was later
                                    hospitalized with dessication.

                                    Six months later, Matsui defeated his arch-rival Akira Masuda at the finals
                                    of the All-Japan Open 1987, winning the title for the second year running.
                                    His victory meant that he entered the World Championship that November
                                    under an enormous burden of expectation. Sosai Oyama had declared that
                                    while he lived, no non-Japanese fighter would ever take the world title away
                                    from the ‘motherland of karate’. Matsui knew he was fighting for the honour
                                    of Japan. He defended it with a barrage of punches and spectacular axe-
                                    kicks, overpowering Andy Hug of Switzerland in the final. Before he faced
                                    Hug, however, he had to overcome the formidable challenges posed by
                                    Shinichi Sotodate, Akira Masuda and Michael Thompson. His fight with
                                    Thompson reached an unprecedented 5 th extension before Matsui won with
                                    nonstop low kicks and a final knock-out kick to the head. At twenty-four, he
                                    was the youngest World Champion ever. His final tournament record stands
                                    at an incredible 50 wins over 6 losses.

                                    From being Chief Instructor at Honbu dojo, Matsui went on to open his own
                                    school in Asakusa, Tokyo. Sosai Oyama first appointed him Branch Chief,
                                    then nominated him his own successor as Kancho (President) of the
                                    International Karate Organisation. The sudden death of Sosai in 1994 left
                                    Matsui at the helm of the IKO. Within the next two years, he organized the
                                    11 th All Japan Weight Tournament, the hugely successful 27 th All Japan
                                    Open, and the 6 th World Open Karate Tournament. Since then, he has
                                    faithfully carried on Sosai Oyama’s tradition of staging a World Tournament
                                    every four years while breaking new ground with events like the Women’s
                                    World Karate Championship, International Senior and Youth
                                    Championships, the ‘World Cup’ – Team Karate Championship and the
                                    International Kata Championship.

                                <p>
                                    Under his direction, the IKO has grown to a total strength of over 12 million
                                    members, with branches in 125 nations. Besides managing the entire
                                    organization from its headquarters at Honbu, the Kancho travels constantly,
                                    teaching and spreading the culture of Kyokushin to countries round the
                                    world. The global future of Kyokushin Karate seems assured, and the legacy
                                    of Mas Oyama safe, in the hands of Kancho Shokei Matsui.
